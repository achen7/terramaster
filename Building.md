# Required libraries #

Java Map Projection Library
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmapprojlib/

I use version 1.0.6 with no complaints.

SVNKit - Subversion for Java
http://svnkit.com/download.php

I use version 1.3.8 (Standalone, without JNA), which is found at [this link](http://www.svnkit.com/org.tmatesoft.svn_1.3.8.standalone.nojna.zip). You only need the "svnkit.jar" file.

# Details #

You should have Make on your system (BSD or GNU Make both work).

Type "make" (or "gmake") to build the jar.
